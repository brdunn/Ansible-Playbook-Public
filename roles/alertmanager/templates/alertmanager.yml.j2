  # When a new group of alerts is created by an incoming alert, wait at
  # least 'group_wait' to send the initial notification.
  # This way ensures that you get multiple alerts for the same group that start
  # firing shortly after another are batched together on the first
  # notification.
  group_wait: 10s

  # When the first notification was sent, wait 'group_interval' to send a batch
  # of new alerts that started firing for that group.

  # If an alert has successfully been sent, wait 'repeat_interval' to
  # resend them.
